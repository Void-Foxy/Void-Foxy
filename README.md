I'm Ryan, a student at Ontario Tech University majoring in Game Development and Interactive Media
I have a high interest in game design, AI, and Board games

All secondary school work have been made in Python (with the library PyGame) or Java

University Projects are made with either Unity and C# scripting, or Unreal using Blueprints
